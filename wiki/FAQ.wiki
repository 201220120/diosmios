= I just get a black screen (no DIOS MIOS splash screen) =
Chances are high that your USB2IDE device isn't supported.
 * Assure that your HDD is formatted with FAT32, no other FS is supported.
 * Only cluster sizes 32KB or less are supported.
 * The FAT32 partition MUST be the first primaly partition on the HDD, otherwise it will not work.
 * If all the above are ok try another USB2IDE device or wait for an update.

= I just get a black screen AFTER the DIOS MIOS splash screen =
Before anything check the [https://code.google.com/p/diosmios/wiki/GameIssues game issues] wiki page.
 If your game isn't listed you should try the following:
 * Verify that your dump is ok, just google for the md5 hash.
 * Try to install the game with DiscEX (without -c)
 * Assure that the game isn't just waiting for the debugger
 * Try to use a game version that matches your region
 * Verify your loader settings and turn off things like NMM/Force-Prog, NMM/Force-Prog can cause black screens

= It takes long for the DIOS MIOS splash screen to show up =
DIOS MIOS looks for an USB device on port 0 first and has code in place which waits for a device to become ready, only after (10seconds) it tries port 1. 
 * Simply connect your device to port 0 instead.

= I get a green screen after the DIOS MIOS splash screen =
This usually can have three reasons:
 * You have the debugger with waiting enabled
 * The game just crashed (should get a crash dump via USBGecko if `__`fwrite patch was applied)
 * The game tried to switch from one video mode to another, usually happens when loading USA games on EUR systems or vice versa.

= I get "Fatal error apploader size is zero!" =
This means DM was unable to mount the selected ISO for whatever reason.
 * Verify that your dump is ok, just google for the md5 hash.
 * Try to install the game again (delete the old folder before)

= My system shuts down when using NMM while loading/saving =
 * In short NMM isn't supported for that game.
 * This means a fatal error occurred in the NMM code and it could no longer assure stable program execution.

= Will NTFS ever be supported? =
 * No, it would also take way more space than there is available. Just so you know libNTFS for Wii/GC is about 500KB, total memory DM can use is 96KB and almost everything is already used up.

= Will the Wiimote/Classic Controller ever be supported? =
 * No, this would require a complete SDIO/BlueTooth/Wiimote lib, which would also take up way more space than available. (BT+Wiimote lib in libOGC are ~600KB).

= Will WBFS ever be supported? =
HAHA nice joke.
